# Native implementation notes

How the native application works internally. For what Theta is, how to build and run it, and the user-facing feature list and shortcuts, see [the root README](../README.md).

## Layout

`src/` holds the application. `src/tests/` holds the test runners and their scenario files — see [the test README](src/tests/README.md). `assets/` is compiled in as JUCE binary data. `.deps/` holds pinned JUCE and Tracktion checkouts fetched by `scripts/fetch-dependencies.py`; it is ignored by version control and is not Theta's code.

A class may be defined across several translation units. `Session` is implemented in `Session.cpp` plus the `Session*.cpp` files; `Arrangement` in `Arrangement.cpp` plus `ArrangementGeometry.cpp` and its siblings. Every source file is listed explicitly in `CMakeLists.txt` — nothing is globbed, so a new file needs a line there.

## Boundaries

- Tracktion owns edits, playback graphs, streaming, parameters and device state; the UI does not schedule audio.
- Utility's processing path uses an atomic parameter read and a preallocated smoother. It handles sub-buffer offsets and shares the same gain ramp across channels. Its stable type ID is `theta.utility.v1`, with a `gainDb` parameter.
- Slider feedback happens directly in the control event path; gain gestures use the engine's automation hooks. A 10 Hz timer updates only transport text. The playhead uses JUCE's display-vblank callback and narrow damage strips at its old and new positions; note data stays cached between edits. The note ruler is outside these strips, and arrangement navigation updates the line immediately. Neither is an audio scheduler.
- Both playheads are blue and retain fractional-pixel positions. Each display refresh reads the audio graph's latency-adjusted audible position directly, bypassing Tracktion's 50 Hz transport-property timer. Stopped/scrub positions and immediate pending seeks remain responsive. Position precision still follows the audio processing cadence; this is not a claim of measured end-to-end display latency.
- The pinned Windows Direct2D renderer collects damage in `WM_PAINT`, but invokes vblank listeners before painting damage collected earlier. After moving a playhead, `Playhead.cpp` uses [UpdateWindow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-updatewindow) to submit its new damage before that frame is drawn. This avoids erasing the old line while clipping out the new one. The handoff is restricted to Windows Direct2D; macOS and the software renderer use normal JUCE invalidation. Recheck this adapter when upgrading JUCE. Regression checks cover the native damage handoff and compare incremental frames with full renders at 100%, 125%, 150%, and 200% scale; they do not measure live display frame pacing.
- Arrangement clip geometry is cached between edit notifications. Waveforms share a thumbnail per source file, scan samples on JUCE's thumbnail worker, and repaint their own clip regions as data arrives. Pointer movement updates only a local preview; the engine edit and undo transaction change once on release. UI selection stores clip IDs rather than pointers that would become stale during undo or project replacement.
- Save serializes a detached engine snapshot on a background worker, writes a temporary file beside the destination, and replaces the target on success. Edits during saving remain dirty. Open parses off-thread, validates before replacing the active edit, and detaches UI listeners before releasing the old edit. Engine reconstruction still happens on the message thread; controls are disabled during open to prevent losing concurrent edits.
- No synthetic large sessions, capacity claims, or FPS benchmark harness are included. Frame pacing and pointer latency remain design requirements to measure later. Import metadata work still runs on the message thread and needs background preparation before the production browser grows.

## Adding a device

Devices derive from `te::Plugin` and follow a fixed shape: a stable `xmlTypeName` (`theta.<name>.v1`), the `getName`/`getPluginType`/`getVendor` overrides, and parameters wired through `referTo` / `addParam` / `attachToCurrentValue`, detached in the destructor and refreshed in `restorePluginStateFromValueTree`.

Registration is currently hand-wired rather than table-driven, so a new device must also be added to `createBuiltInType` in `Session.cpp`, the relevant enum-to-type mapping, and the browser id maps. Check every site before assuming one edit is enough.

## Dependencies

Pinned to the source-study Tracktion revision and its exact JUCE submodule revision. See `scripts/fetch-dependencies.py` for hashes. Upstream licence files are retained inside `.deps`; this does not change the licensing findings in the research.
